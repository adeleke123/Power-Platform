## Summary

In this module, you learned more about controls and how you can incorporate them into your app. You also learned about the properties of controls and how you can modify them to enhance the functionality of your app. Depending on the app that you're developing, you can use several different controls, or you can only use a few specific ones. Here are a few important points to remember:

+ There are many control options for placing text on a screen or allowing a user to enter text.

+ Use the pre-populated value controls to provide choices for the user.

+ By adding media controls directly to your app, you can enhance the functionality and reduce the number of steps for your user. For example, users can enter their expenses and upload their receipts without leaving the app.
