## Images

The Image control is a control that shows an image. The image may be from a local file or a data source. Adding an image, such as a company logo is an easy way to enhance the overall look and feel of your app. On each screen you can apply a Background image, and multiple Image controls. You're not limited to some images that you can display; you can have as many images as you would like. Too many images may cause issues with the app performance and load times, but you would have to add quite a few large images for this to be an issue. There's a set of properties specific to the Image control that allow you to customize how the image is displayed. When working with the Image control, a few of the more common properties you'll most likely want to modify are the Image, Image position, and Transparency properties.

+ Image - The name of the image that appears in an image, audio, or microphone control.

+ Image Position - The position (Fill, Fit, Stretch, Tile, or Center) of the image in a screen or a control if it isn't the same size as the image.

+ Transparency - The degree to which the controls behind an image remain visible.

Here’s a quick example of how to change the transparency and image position of an Image control.

1. In Power Apps, create a Tablet app using the "Product Showcase" App template.

2. On the left, under Screens, expand Group6 and select Image1.

3. In the right pane, set the Transparency property to 0.5.

You will notice that the image immediately becomes lighter in color.

4. In the Image position property, change this to Center.

The image appears to be zoomed in or larger.

As you develop your app, keep these settings in mind when using the Image control to enhance the look and feel of your app.
