## Summary

There are many options available to enhance the usability and appearance of your app. Throughout this module, you explored themes, properties for changing a control's appearance, using icons and images, personalization, and the different form factors available. Some important items to remember are:

+ There are several out-of-the box or default themes to choose from and these can be easily applied.

+ By modifying various Control properties, you can completely change how the control looks and functions when users interact with the app.

+ Use the User() function to personalize the app. For example, create a Welcome screen and greet the user by using the User() function.

+ You must select the form factor when you begin building your app. After you have selected tablet or phone, it can't be changed. With the tablet form factor, you can adjust the screen size.
