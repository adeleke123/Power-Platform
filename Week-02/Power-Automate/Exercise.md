## Exercise - Create your first flow

In the previous unit we learned about the key concepts such as `templates`, `connectors`, `actions and conditions`. Here we'll put all of those concepts into practice by building your first flow.

Since it can be time consuming to search for attachments in your emails, creating a flow can save you time by storing all your email attachments in a folder in your Microsoft OneDrive for Business account.

## Important concepts in Power Automate
Keep these concepts in mind when building flows:

+ Every flow has two main parts: a trigger, and one or more actions.
+ You can think of the trigger as the starting action for the flow. The trigger can be something like a new email arriving in your inbox or a new item being added to a list in Microsoft Lists.
+ Actions are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked. For example, the new email trigger will start the action of creating a new + file on OneDrive for Business. Other examples of actions include sending an email, posting a tweet, and starting an approval.
+ These concepts will come into play later when you build your own flows from scratch.
